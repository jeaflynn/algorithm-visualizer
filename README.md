# Algorithm Visualizer

- A simple web based visualization tool for sorting algorithms.
- This program was created to assist with understanding of how sorting works by visualizing the process step by step.

# Currently Implemented Algorithms

- Bubble Sort

# Future Algorithms

- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

# Features

- Generate random arrays of numbers
- Visualize the sorting algorithm in action
- Control the sorting speed
- See comparisons and swaps made druing sorting
- Reset and generate new arrays

# Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Claude AI for HTML guidance

# How to Use:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/jeaflynn/algorithm-visualizer.git
```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser
- Locate the file in your directory
- Double clicking will open with default browser

3. Use the controls: 
- **Generate New Array**: Creates a new random array
- **Start Sorting**: Begins the sorting visualization
- **Reset**: Resets the current array
- **Speed**: Adjusts the visualization speed

# How BubbleSort Works

- Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that:
1. Repeatedly steps through the list
2. Compares neighboring elements
3. Swaps them if they are in the wrong order
4. Repeats until the list is sorted
